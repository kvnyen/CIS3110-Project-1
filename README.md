# CIS3110-Project-1

Hello Professor, 
In this repository is Project #1. 
Per the Project Guidelines, Authentication.html accepts a hard coded set of username and passwords.
After logging in, you'll be taken to a landing page, which is the Dashboard.html. In the dashboard, you can then set personal information within the AccountSettings.html. 
After setting your information, you'll receive a pop-up saying your information was successfully saved. You can then view your personal information in the InformationPage.html. The project is 4 pages total but I added a Logout page just for fun. 
The AccountSettings page satisfies the following requirements:
  Cookie setting /  getting
  The details for the user (name, email, phone, etc) are saved on one page, then displayed on another
  Read cookies to display the userâ€™s details
  Write cookies to save their details
The InformationPage satifies the following requirements:
  An information page, where an array of .json or other hard coded array information is displayed as a set of divs on the page, but without css styling
  Add child, set attribute, read json, iterate json
Thank you.
